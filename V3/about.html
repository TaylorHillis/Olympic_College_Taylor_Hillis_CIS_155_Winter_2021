        In V1 of my project four different HTML pages were created. Those pages were index.html, about.html, ships.html, and sources.html. The CSS that is being used is meant to give the website some unique style.
        In V2 of my project no new HTML pages were created. The changes to the pages were the additon of an image map on about.html, the images on the pages were also resized. The CSS was changed to include a reset style sheet, a background image was also added to all of the pages. Some of the veroius styles were also altered.
        In V3 of my project one new HTML pages was created. That page was donations.html. the changes to the CSS were used to estsablish a table in in donations.html.
